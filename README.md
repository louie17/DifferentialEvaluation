# DifferentialEvaluation
## 1.Introduction
Differential Evolution (DE) is a population based stochastic function optimizer algorithm developed by Kenneth Price and Rainer Storn in the 1990s. For detailed information on DE consult any of the numerous online or in print resources listed at the DE homepage http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html.

To quote from the Wikipedia page dedicated to DE (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_evolution).

All this work are based on a great and fairly recent C++ contribution by Adrian Michel called the Differential Evolution C++ library
(http://www.amichel.com/de/doc/html).
